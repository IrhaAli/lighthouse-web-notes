# Week 4 Summary Notes
## Asynchronous Code
* [Async Control Flow](https://flex-web.compass.lighthouselabs.ca/workbooks/flex-m01w4/activities/2073?journey_step=32&workbook=7)
* Functions that return something and have async code always return undefined immediately because the async work hasn't been completed. Click here to understand [async return values](https://flex-web.compass.lighthouselabs.ca/workbooks/flex-m01w4/activities/394?journey_step=32&workbook=7)
* There's setTimout() and setInterval() option. The setTimeout() executes the code after a specified time. The setInterval() executes the code repeatedly after a specified time. To get out of setInterval() use ctrl + c.
* For data fetching, it's better to do it async.
* `Async Operations`: any task that's going to take time (eg. loading a file).
* In the context of async code, a callback is a function that runs once the async code has finished running.
