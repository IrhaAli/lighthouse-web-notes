# Week 2 Compass Summary Notes
* Primitive Types in Javascript
  * undefined
  * null
  * boolean
  * string
  * number
  * symbol
* Objects
  * Contain key-value pairs; each key maps to a value.
  * Contain keys which are always strings (or symbols, but it's less common and not important right now).
  * Have unique keys; the same key cannot appear twice in an object.
  * Have their keys point to values which can be of any type.
* Anything other than the 6 items above are objects. Primitive cannot be modified, however, objects can. The `for in` loop can be used to iterate through an object.

## Functions
* Functions as Objects: FINISH WRITING ABOUT THIS
* Anonymous Functions: FINISH WRITING ABOUT THIS
* Arrow Functions: FINISH WRITING ABOUT THIS
* First Class Functions: FINISH WRITING ABOUT THIS
* Callback Functions: FINISH WRITING ABOUT THIS

## Vim
* Although, I don't understand that point of this software or what it does the main modes of Vim are edit (pressing `i`) and command (by default or pressing `esc`).
* `H,J,K,L`: `H` moves left; `K` moves up; `L` moves right; `J` moves down.
* `Y` copies a line of text to the buffer.
* `P` pastes it to the cursor's current position.
* `dd` will delete the whole line of text. This will also effectively "cut" a line of text as well. When you delete a line, it's placed in the buffer.
* `yy` copies a whole line of text.
* `w` while in command mode, it saves the file.
* `:wq` - write (save) and quit file (and vim)
* `:q!` - quit and ignore changes made since last file save.
